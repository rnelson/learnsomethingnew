# Learn Something New!

## About

Every so often, someone will ask me for suggestions on learning a specific programming language. Sometimes I recommended that language, sometimes they just know that I'm familiar with it. I often have a couple of resources for them, but I never remember all of them. This is especially true when I spend some time learning a language and either know it well enough that I don't need to refer back to those beginner guides or I move on to something else and forget the language.

Many others have built lists of resources you should use to learn _X_, and I've even seen some like this repo where they kept a list of links for a large variety of things. I encourage you to search those out as well. This is **my** list, things that **I** recommend.

It's starting out as a list of Python resources, as that's one commonly asked to me and that, more importantly, was asked before I decided to build this. Eventually, I'll build it out with additional programming languages, operating systems, frameworks, and so forth.

# Somethings To Learn

In addition to my lists, I've used [Added Bytes' cheat sheets](https://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/) for many things over the years.
