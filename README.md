# Learn Something New!

## About

Every so often, someone will ask me for suggestions on learning a specific programming language. Sometimes I recommended that language, sometimes they just know that I'm familiar with it. I often have a couple of resources for them, but I never remember all of them. This is especially true when I spend some time learning a language and either know it well enough that I don't need to refer back to those beginner guides or I move on to something else and forget the language.

Many others have built lists of resources you should use to learn _X_, and I've even seen some like this repo where they kept a list of links for a large variety of things. I encourage you to search those out as well. This is **my** list, things that **I** recommend.

# Somethings To Learn

## Operating Systems

While I do use Windows for work and the occasional project, almost everything else I do is on some form of UNIX-like system. The [Sysadmin's Unixersal Translator](http://bhami.com/rosetta.html) is an incredibly useful tool for finding the right command to do something on various UNIXes/UNIX-like systems.

Where available, I've added a link to the appropriate [PLEAC](http://pleac.sourceforge.net) page for each language. PLEAC, or Programming Language Examples Alike Cookbook, follows the [Perl Cookbook](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook) in a number of other programming languages.
