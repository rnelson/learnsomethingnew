# FreeBSD

# About

[FreeBSD](http://freebsd.org) is one of the two oldest BSD operating systems out there, along with NetBSD (not including commercial systems that incorporate pieces of BSD). Starting as a set of patches from the community to [386BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/386BSD), FreeBSD eventually became an entirely new operating system that they could keep updated without relying on the people in charge of 386BSD.

Of the three most popular BSDs (FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD), FreeBSD is often considered the overall best. NetBSD focuses on being portable to anything and everything, while OpenBSD focuses on being secure. More of a general use system, FreeBSD has a larger userbase, many corporate sponsors helping pay for continued development, and good hardware support. While I like and use the other two, FreeBSD is one of the main operating systems I use. I recommend it as a starting point for anyone interested in trying out the BSD family.

## Books/Tutorials

+ [A FreeBSD Desktop How-to](https://cooltrainer.org/a-freebsd-desktop-howto/): start-to-finish instructions on installing FreeBSD on your desktop.
+ [FreeBSD Handbook](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/): one of the best pieces of documentation I've run across. It doesn't go as far in depth as the above how-to for setting up a modern desktop environment, but all of the basics and many advanced topics are covered.
+ [FreeBSD Wiki](https://wiki.freebsd.org): the official wiki for the FreeBSD project.
+ [FreeBSD - a lesson in poor defaults](https://vez.mrsk.me/freebsd-defaults.txt): a post giving some suggestions on improving a vanilla FreeBSD install.
+ [The Complete FreeBSD](http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/CFBSD/): an old book, but much of the information is probably still relevant.
+ [FreeBSD CheatSheet](http://www.cambus.net/freebsd-cheatsheet/): appropriately named, it's a cheat sheet of common commands.
+ [BSD For Linux Users](http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/01): a helpful guide for people familiar with Linux who are trying FreeBSD.

## Software

+ [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/where.html)
+ [PC-BSD](http://www.pcbsd.org): a variant of FreeBSD that updates fairly quickly after new FreeBSD releases. It has some nice features on top of the base system (PBIs, [Warden](http://wiki.pcbsd.org/index.php/WardenÂ®/10.1/en)) and is tailored to desktop use out of the box. My local development server runs TrueOS, which is the server variant of PC-BSD (no GUI by default).
