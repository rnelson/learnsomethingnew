# About

[FreeBSD](http://freebsd.org) is one of the two oldest BSD operating systems out there, along with NetBSD (not including commercial systems that incorporate pieces of BSD). Starting as a set of patches from the community to [386BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/386BSD), FreeBSD eventually became an entirely new operating system that they could keep updated without relying on the people in charge of 386BSD.

Of the three most popular BSDs (FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD), FreeBSD is often considered the overall best. NetBSD focuses on being portable to anything and everything, while OpenBSD focuses on being secure. More of a general use system, FreeBSD has a larger userbase, many corporate sponsors helping pay for continued development, and good hardware support. While I like and use the other two, FreeBSD is one of the main operating systems I use. I recommend it as a starting point for anyone interested in trying out the BSD family.
