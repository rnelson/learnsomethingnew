# Ada

# About

Ada is a Pascal-like language originally developed for the US Department of Defense. It is (was?) known for being a very _safe_ language. Compilers are generally very strict and there are various run-time checks to avoid problems.

I learned a tiny bit of Ada for a programming languages class years ago. I've often considered picking it up again, but I have no practical use for it.

The links below are simply a collection of my bookmarks.

# Free Resources

## Books/Tutorials

+ [Ada 95](http://www.computer-books.us/ada95.php): An assortment of freely downloadable ebooks on Ada 95.
+ [The Big Online Book of Linux Ada Programming](http://www.pegasoft.ca/resources/boblap/book.html): information on working with Ada on Linux. Chapters 10 and 11 cover quite a bit of the language.
+ [Ada 83 Language Reference Manual](http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-IDX.html): a thorough index of Ada 83. Many entries include both the grammar (useful for someone wanting to build an Ada compiler) and sample code showing their use.
+ [PLEAC Ada](http://pleac.sourceforge.net/pleac_ada/index.html): a cookbook giving examples of doing things in Ada. The book exists [for a variety of languages](http://pleac.sourceforge.net).
+ [Ada Programming](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Programming) wikibook: book written by the community covering the basic language, third party libraries, and more.
+ [Ada 95 Tutorial](http://www.infres.enst.fr/~pautet/Ada95/a95list.htm): another book covering the language, including advanced features.

## Software

+ [GNAT](http://libre.adacore.com): one of the few big Ada compilers. Based on GCC, there's a free open source version. Note that [there may be licensing issues](http://gnuada.sourceforge.net/pmwiki.php/Main/GMGPL) (unconfirmed).
+ [GNU Ada](http://gnuada.sourceforge.net): Provides [downloads](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuada/files/) of GCC with Ada support, like GNAT, for a variety of platforms. Unlike GNAT, the download includes not only the Ada compiler but also [C/C++](https://github.com/rnelson/learnsomethingnew/blob/master/programming_languages/cpp.md), [Objective-C](https://github.com/rnelson/learnsomethingnew/blob/master/programming_languages/objc.md), Objective-C++, and [Fortran](https://github.com/rnelson/learnsomethingnew/blob/master/programming_languages/fortran.md).
+ [AdaGIDE](http://adagide.martincarlisle.com/index.html): a small Ada IDE for Windows.
