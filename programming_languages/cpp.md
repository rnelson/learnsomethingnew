# C/C++

# About

Created in the early 80s as "C with Classes," C++ is an extension to C providing object oriented programming on top of C.

Many of my undergraduate classes either taught and required C++ or, as a result of it being the only language students knew, were generally done in C++ by students. I had largely moved on to C# for the last two years, but still did the occasional C++.

To this day, I have fond memories of working in C++, both for homework and my first professional (student) developer job. Unfortunately, every time I've tried to work with it since, I see so much "missing" from newer languages and quickly abandon C++ again.

Going through my old bookmarks, I discovered that I had very few beginner links for C. As a result, I've lumped the two together into my C++ page. Learning C++ teaches you quite a bit of C, even if you only use the C++ replacements for C. In practice, if you write a sufficient amount of C++, you'll have to learn how to do things like memory management (aka malloc, free) while trying to use third party libraries.

# Free Resources

## Books/Tutorials

+ [PLEAC for C++](http://pleac.sourceforge.net/pleac_c++/index.html): a cookbook giving examples of doing things in C++. The book exists [for a variety of languages](http://pleac.sourceforge.net).
+ [The C Book](http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/): an out of print book on C from 1991. While it obviously doesn't cover the latest standards, it's still an excellent resource.
+ [C Programming and C++ Programming](http://www.cprogramming.com): this site covers much of what I ever needed to know when learning C and C++. It's an excellent reference. [The C tutorial](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c-tutorial.html) and [the C++ tutorial](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c++-tutorial.html) may work well as a beginner resource.
+ [C++ Reference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/): another great site to use as a reference for looking up specific things.
+ [Standard Template Library Programmer's Guide](http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/): the STL is slightly beyond beginner in many cases, but it is somewhat confusing for people new to C++. This site gives a lot of technical details as well as plenty of examples of working with the STL.

## Software

+ [Dev-C++](http://orwelldevcpp.blogspot.com): free C++ IDE for Windows. This is a fork of the old Dev-C++, which has long been abandoned.
+ [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org): a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, OS X) IDE for C, C++, and Fortran.
+ [Eclipse CDT](http://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.cdt): Eclipse as a C/C++ IDE.
+ [Biicode](https://www.biicode.com): dependency manager for C/C++ projects. As with the STL guide, this is a bit beyond beginner, but Biicode and projects like it are worth knowing about when you start working in the language.
