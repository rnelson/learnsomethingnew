# C\#

# About

C# is Microsoft's attempt to build a language that doesn't suck. ;-) It shares a lot with Java, but removes a lot of the annoyances of working with Java.

The one huge downside is, while [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com) exists, it's far from complete so anything .NET is often tied to Windows. With Microsoft open sourcing parts of the .NET stack, server-side ASP.NET programming can be done on Linux/OS X, but desktop apps written in C# and VB.NET are likely to be buggy or not run at all on anything but Windows.

My list of resources is pretty small here. While first learning the language, I purchased some books and learned primarily from those. The few C#-related bookmarks I have are for advanced topics that I needed help with.

# Free Resources

## Software

+ [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com): the Community edition of Visual Studio provides a free Windows IDE for [C/C++](https://github.com/rnelson/learnsomethingnew/blob/master/programming_languages/cpp.md), C#, and Visual Basic.
+ [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx): an open source clone of older versions of Visual Studio. I used this until I got a free copy of Visual Studio from school (back when no Express or Community editions existed)

# Paid Resources

+ [Programming C#](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-5-0-Building-Applications-Framework/dp/1449320414/ref=dp_ob_title_bk): I own [the fourth edition](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Building-Applications-Jesse-Liberty/dp/0596006993) of this book, which is horribly outdated and covers .NET 1.1 and 2.0. Note that Amazon states this book is targeted toward experienced developers. While you need not know C# to read it, prior experience programming in at least one other language is probably very helpful.
