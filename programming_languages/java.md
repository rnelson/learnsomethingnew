# Java

# About

Introduced in the 1990s, Java is an object-oriented language known for its slogan, ["write once, run anywhere"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere). Instead of being compiled to native machine code like [C/C++](https://github.com/rnelson/learnsomethingnew/blob/master/programming_languages/cpp.md), the program's source is turned into JVM bytecode. To run the program, a user simply needs to install a [Java Virtual Machine](https://www.java.com) and run the program.

Of course, there are ways to break that (interfacing with native code, hard-coding file paths, etc.), but in theory any Java program will run on any JVM.

## Books/Tutorials

+ [Thinking in Java](http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/): freely downloadable Java book. Note that the current edition is not free, but this one will be more than sufficient for learning the language.
+ [Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 24 Hours](http://www.informit.com/library/library.aspx?b=STY_Java2_24hours): while outdated, this book prove useful to some people.
+ [Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html): a big list by Sun/Oracle of tutorials covering many aspects of Java.

## Software

+ [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/): like PyCharm for Python, IDEA is available in a Community Edition. It lacks some of the features of the Ultimate edition, but it's been more than sufficient for my needs.
+ [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org): another free cross-platform IDE. This was my IDE of choice until I discovered IDEA.
+ [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php): I don't like Eclipse. That said, many others do. Like the above, free and cross-platform. Try 'em all and see which one you prefer!
