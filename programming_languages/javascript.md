# JavaScript

# About

JavaScript is **not** [Java](https://github.com/rnelson/learnsomethingnew/blob/master/programming_languages/java.md).

JavaScript, traditionally, existed for making the web a bit more interactive. Lately, it's become popular for server-side programming as well as local utilities (see [node.js](http://nodejs.org)/[io.js](https://iojs.org)).

Historically, different browsers supported different subsets of JavaScript, making a lot of tasks very difficult. Even those things which are supported the same by all browsers are sometimes fairly long and complicated to do in JavaScript. As a result, various libraries appeared to ease writing JavaScript. My library of choice is [jQuery](https://jquery.com). Others include [MooTools](http://mootools.net) and [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org).

Despite current trends of telling people not to include jQuery on everything, I still do. I don't do a lot of frontend work, so the less I have to fight with JavaScript each time I work with it, the better. Many of my links below are jQuery-specific.
