# TeX/LaTeX

# About

TeX is a document formatting system. While not a programming language, per se, it is somewhat similar in that you write this semi-cryptic code, run it through a program, and out pops something more useful. (In practice, it's often a PDF.)

LaTeX is a program for processing LaTeX files, which are TeX files that utilize a number of additional macros. I have not seen anything recent where people chose TeX over LaTeX or some variant of LaTeX, though it may still be in use.

TeX (and by extension LaTeX and friends) is popular in the computer science and mathematics fields because it allows easy formatting of complex math formulas.
