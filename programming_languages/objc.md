# Objective-C

# About

Created in the early 1980s, the only actual uses of it I've ever seen are NeXT and Apple (which bought NeXT). It is the primary language for OS X and iOS development, though [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) was created to be an easier and safer language and is supported on current versions of both OS X and iOS.

Before jumping into Objective-C, I recommend learning a little bit of [C](https://github.com/rnelson/learnsomethingnew/blob/master/programming_languages/cpp.md). Like C++, Objective-C is a superset of C. The basic structure is largely taken from C, but object-oriented features were added on top of it. Knowing a little C in advance probably make working with Objective-C easier.

Most of my bookmarks are from my first time writing iOS (so long ago that it was still called iPhone OS at the time) applications. My more recent iOS dev has been a game in [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com), so I'm not sure how relevant some of these are today. A lot of them are specific solutions to problems I ran into. Of the generic resources I had bookmarked, only one is still around today.

## Software

+ [PLEAC-Objective-C](http://pleac.sourceforge.net/pleac_objective-c/index.html): Perl Cookbook, but for Objective-C.
+ [5 Free Resources for iPhone App Development](http://johntwang.com/blog/2009/06/09/5-free-resources-for-iphone-app-development/): useful resources for building on iOS.

# Paid Resources

+ [AppCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/): JetBrains' (IDEA, PyCharm, RubyMotion) IDE for doing OS X/iOS development. Supports both Objective-C and Swift. As my current iOS development is in Ruby, I have not actually tried AppCode yet. Based on the way Xcode, Apple's supported IDE, has been going the last many years and my experience with other JetBrains IDEs, AppCode is worth at least trying out.
