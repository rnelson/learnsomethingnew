# Pascal

# About

Pascal is an old compiled language originally created, in part, to be used as a teaching language. It was very popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but has since largely died out.

Notable, a lot of early Apple development was done in Pascal, and [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) helped change the way that software was developed; additionally, Turbo Pascal helped lower the entry price for new software developers.

Delphi is a commercial variant of Object Pascal, the object-oriented version of Pascal. While it only runs on Windows, it can currently compile for Windows, OS X, iOS, and Android. I occasionally run across job listings for it, but [online communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/delphi/) are pretty active, telling me there must be quite a few people out there still working in it.

Like [C#](https://github.com/rnelson/learnsomethingnew/blob/master/programming_languages/csharp.md), most of what I learned was from an old Delphi book. I've written some Pascal lately, but I simply search for how to do a specific thing (e.g., "Pascal for loop") and move on, so I don't have any non-software resources to list.

Read more about [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)), [Object Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal), and [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)) at Wikipedia.

# Free Resources

## Software

+ [Free Pascal](http://www.freepascal.org): an open source compiler with a Turbo Pascal-like IDE.
+ [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org): an open source Delphi-like IDE that uses Free Pascal.
+ [MSEide+MSEgui](http://www.msegui.org): another open source IDE for Free Pascal. I have not tried this one out yet, but it looks similar to (though less polished than) Lazarus
+ [Dev-Pascal](http://bloodshed.net/devpascal.html): a Pascal IDE for Windows. This project seems to have been abandoned years ago; unlike Dev-C++, I am unaware of any community projects created to continue developemtn on Dev-Pascal.

# Paid Resources

+ [Delphi](http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi): the one commercial compiler and IDE I know of that is still actively developed and sold. While it builds for other platforms, Delphi itself will only run under Windows.
