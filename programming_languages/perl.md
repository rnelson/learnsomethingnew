# Perl

# About

Perl is an old scripting language that's still heavily used today. Once used as the primary language for CGI scripts, Perl's primary use these days seems to be system administration tools.

The language is [highly criticized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl#Criticism), but when written correctly it can be easily read and maintained. I've picked up bits and pieces of Perl over the years to write small scripts, but I prefer [Python](https://github.com/rnelson/learnsomethingnew/blob/master/programming_languages/python.md) or Ruby.
