# About

[This](http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/) is really all you need to know about PHP.

Okay, fine. While PHP certainly has **many** issues, it is still one of the easiest langauges to get started with for web development. Looking through my bookmarks, I don't actually have much to put for PHP. I started playing around with the language in high school, and in 2005 was writing my first large project with it. By the time I started using [del.icio.us](http://delicious.com) (later migrating to [pinboard](http://pinboard.in)), I had long lost any PHP-related tutorial bookmarks.

## Books/Tutorials

+ [PHP: a fractal of bad design](http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/): criticism of many aspects of the language and its standard library.

# Paid Resources

+ [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/): JetBrains' PHP IDE. I briefly used this after receiving a free copy of v2 at a hackathon, but soon moved on to Panic's [Coda](https://panic.com/coda/). If I were writing large amounts of PHP, I would definitely give a current version of PhpStorm another shot.
