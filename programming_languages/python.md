# Python

# About

[Python](http://python.org) is a [scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) first released in 1991. While excellent as a general purpose language, it seems to be popular for data analysis, system administration (hello, [Red Hat](http://redhat.com)!), and web programming.

At present, two major versions are actively being worked on (v2, v3). Python 3, formerly known as [Python 3000](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3000/) broke compatibility. Some, but not all, scripts written for Python 2 will not run in Python 3 without modifications. Additionally, scripts tailored to Python 3 will not necessarily run in Python 2. For more information, see the Python wiki's article, [Should I use Python 2 or Python 3 for my development activity?](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) I use Python 3 exclusively for new projects and recommend you jump straight into 3.

Every major OS except Windows either ships with Python or makes it available in their native package manager. Additionally, it's available [on python.org's download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [from ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads). (ActiveState provides builds for Python, Perl, and Tcl intended for commercial use, but offer a community edition for non-production use. I have not used any of their software other than ActivePerl, and that was back in the 1990s.)

# Free Resources

## Books/Tutorials

+ [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/): a guide covering all kinds of best practices for use with Python developers.
+ [PLEAC-Python](http://pleac.sourceforge.net/pleac_python/index.html): Perl Cookbook, but for Python.
+ [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/): this is an excellent book for learning Python. It starts out with basic language features and goes on to advanced topics like string parsing (ex 49), building games (ex 45), and doing web programming (ex 50-52). The author (Zed A. Shaw) makes it available for free both as a try-before-you-buy and for those who cannot afford to pay. It is also available for purchase, which includes a PDF copy of the book, videos for each exercise, and the option to receive help via email from Shaw. This book suggests that people continue to work with Python 2 for compatibility reasons; while I disagree with that, the content is still really good.
+ [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html): I don't have a whole lot to say about this one. It's a standard beginner book for a language, the kind of book that I would buy to quickly pick up a language now (knowing so many others and being able to skim over the first many chapters and just focusing on syntax). In addition to reading it online and buying the physical copy, you can freely download [the PDF](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf), great for those who read on tablets and e-readers. The book's page also links to a modified copy for learning Python 3.
+ [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net): downloadable book on Python 2.
+ [Dive Into Python 3](http://www.diveinto.org/python3/): the follow-up to the above book, this time tailored to Python 3.
+ [Python Basics](http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~warner/prog/python.html): meant for programmers with experience in other languages, this page is somewhat hard to read but covers the basic syntax fairly well, making it easy to jump right in and start writing Python.
+ [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html): direct from the developers, this extensive tutorial covers Python 2. It is also available in [a Python 3 version](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).

## Software

+ [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): I can't speak highly enough of the IDEs from JetBrains. They are all variants of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) that have been tailored to a specific language. Like IDEA, PyCharm is available in a Community Edition. It lacks some of the features of the Professional edition, but it's been more than sufficient for my needs. Unique to PyCharm, there is also an [Educational Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/) worth checking out if you teach Python to others.

# Paid Resources

+ [Practical Programming](https://pragprog.com/book/gwpy2/practical-programming): this is a great book for learning Python by writing cool things. The first few chapters cover the basics of the language, and after that it moves on to interesting real-world examples that teach you additional features as you go. **Note:** I purchased [the first edition](https://pragprog.com/book/gwpy/practical-programming), which is no longer in print. The second edition is tailored to Python 3; at present, you can get a copy of the first edition by purchasing the second and contacting support.
