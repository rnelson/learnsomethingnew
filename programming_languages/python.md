# Python

# About

[Python](http://python.org) is a [scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) first released in 1991. While excellent as a general purpose language, it seems to be popular for data analysis, system administration (hello, [Red Hat](http://redhat.com)!), and web programming.

Python 3, formerly known as [Python 3000](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3000/) broke compatibility so some, but not all, scripts written for Python 2 will not run in Python 3 without modifications. Don't use Python 2. Just don't do it.

Every major OS except Windows either ships with Python or makes it available in their native package manager. Additionally, it's available [on python.org's download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [from ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads). (ActiveState provides builds for Python, Perl, and Tcl intended for commercial use, but offer a community edition for non-production use. I have not used any of their software other than ActivePerl, and that was back in the 1990s.) [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is popular, but I prefer to just install the latest version and use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to handle the packages.

# Free Resources

## Books/Tutorials

+ [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/): a guide covering all kinds of best practices for use with Python developers.
+ [PLEAC-Python](http://pleac.sourceforge.net/pleac_python/index.html): Perl Cookbook, but for Python.
+ [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/): I don't have a whole lot to say about this one. It's a standard beginner book for a language, the kind of book that I would buy to quickly pick up a language now (knowing so many others and being able to skim over the first many chapters and just focusing on syntax). In addition to reading it online and buying the physical copy, you can freely download [the PDF](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf), great for those who read on tablets and e-readers.
+ [Python Basics](http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~warner/prog/python.html): meant for programmers with experience in other languages, this page is somewhat hard to read but covers the basic syntax fairly well, making it easy to jump right in and start writing Python.
+ [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html): direct from the developers!

## Software

+ [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): I can't speak highly enough of the IDEs from JetBrains. They are all variants of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) that have been tailored to a specific language. Like IDEA, PyCharm is available in a Community Edition. It lacks some of the features of the Professional edition, but it's been more than sufficient for my needs. Unique to PyCharm, there is also an [Educational Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/) worth checking out if you teach Python to others.

# Paid Resources

+ [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/): this is an excellent book for learning Python. The version for Python 2 was free, but the Python 3 one is paid only.
+ [Practical Programming](https://pragprog.com/titles/gwpy3/practical-programming-third-edition/): this is a great book for learning Python by writing cool things. I bought the first edition forever ago, covering Python 2. Haven't read the subsequent editions, but I'm sure they're awsome.
