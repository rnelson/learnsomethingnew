# About

Along with [Python](https://github.com/rnelson/learnsomethingnew/blob/master/programming_languages/python.md), Ruby is one of the most popular languages today.

A big part of its popularity is the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) frameworks for building websites. I've done a little bit of Rails, but have primarily used [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) as I often don't need all of the bells and whistles that Rails provides.

Most of my personal projects these days are written in Ruby. Like Python, the language is very expressive and easy to work with, but Ruby has a lot of nice features that make it easier to write in (IMO). You really can't go wrong learning one or the other, and once you know one you can pick up the other pretty easily.

## Books/Tutorials

+ [why's (Poignent) Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/): an excellent starting point for learning Ruby.

## Software

+ [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org): interactive website for trying Ruby from your browser.
+ [RVM](https://rvm.io): the Ruby Version Manager for UNIX-like systems, a utility for installing multiple Rubies into your home directory, as well as managing separate sets of third-party libraries. Highly recommended.
+ [RailsInstaller](http://www.railsinstaller.org/en): an install of Ruby, Rails, and many additional libraries. Copies exist for OS X, but I recommend RVM there. This installer is great for Windows users.

# Paid Resources

+ [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/rubymine/): JetBrains' Ruby IDE. I've used this both for Rails development and RubyMotion. Unfortunately, there is no community edition, but if you're using it exclusively for open source development you can get a free OSS license.
+ [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com): commercial toolchain for building OS X, iOS, and Android applications with Ruby.
