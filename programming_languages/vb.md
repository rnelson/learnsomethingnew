# Visual Basic

# About

Over the summer of 1998, I was trying to learn anything and everything I could about computers. Given that our home computer was a 486 running MS-DOS 6.0 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11, I only had so much I could learn, but that didn't stop me.

One day, I decided to run every program in C:\MSDOS. I had learned that /? would show information about most, so I started at the very first .exe/.bat/.com and worked my way down.

I had used the MS-DOS Editor (edit.com) many times, so I was really confused when qbasic.exe opened and it was pretty much the same.

I typed a line and hit enter, planning to quit the program and move on. It yelled at me.

Without internet at home, I was using a computer at the public library 7 days a week to use email, read news, and research whatever interested me at the time. The next day, I went to the library and looked up information on qbasic.exe and found out that QBasic was a BASIC interpreter, which meant absolutely nothing to me. What did mean something to me was one simple revelation: I CAN WRITE MY OWN SOFTWARE!

Abusing the library's policy of allowing unlimited free prints from the inkjet printers attached to those two computers as long as you provided the paper, I printed out dozens (hundreds?) of pages of information on QBasic over the next month or two.

I learned a lot about QBasic, dabbled in Apple II BASIC the following semester in school, and eventually moved on to Visual Basic. I spent countless hours during high school writing stupid little programs in Visual Basic.

Shortly after starting college, I had learned some C++ and bought a PowerBook, so VB was less useful to me. After picking up C# and finding Mono, I stopped installing VB on our computers.

Spoiler alert: if you spent a ton of hours learning to program using VB, that will _not_ automatically make it fun to work with in the real world after you've used many better languages. Maintaining a very large, very old, very not-properly-architected VB program is kind of painful, even with nostalgia. ;-)

Don't write VB.NET if you can avoid it. It's not really any easier than C#; in fact, once you know both, a lot of stuff is harder to work with in VB.NET. More importantly, it's very difficult to find help on a lot of newer topics (I'm looking at you, WPF) in VB.NET as much of the industry seems to have moved on to C#.
